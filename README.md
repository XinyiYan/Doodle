This sketching program includes:

- a menu bar with a flie menu supporting saving & loading bin files
- a customizable palette supporting color selection and stroke thickness/width. Users can determine what colors the color palette displays by right clicking one of those six color buttons.
- a canvas that supports drawing by using mouse strokes. Canvas is fully accessible regardless of the size of the window, by resizing itself to fit the available space
- a play button that causes the strokes to be drawn, from the current slider position(or the begining) to the end
- a playback button that plays animations backward and rewinds to the start of the animation
- a slider on the bottom that supports scrubbing. If a user scrubs back and starts drawing, non-displayed strokes would be removed and new strokes that the user creates will be appended to the visible strokes on the display.
